# Car-Price-Prediction
<p> Made a ML model using to predict car prices using Linear Regression. <br>
<p> The dataset is taken from Kaggle and also provided in the repository. <br>
<p> Scikit-learn is used to import Linear Regression Model. <br>
<p> Then the data is divided into training and test data, and are fitted to the Regression Model. <br>
<p> THe R2 score is coming less, so it's not very accurate and will be improving the model in the future <br>
